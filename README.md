# coach_survival

This repo contains all scripts for a project studying exit discrimination in the market for NFL head coaches. The associated paper has received an R&R at the *Sociology of Sport Journal*.

To replicate this project, setup a new directory *D:/coach_survival/* and run the following scripts:
1. Run *coach_survival_scraping_by.py* to scrape all data on NFL head coaches
2. Run *coach_survival_analysis.py* to run the main hazard models
3. Run *coach_survival_analysis_team_FE_models.py* to run the main hazard models with team fixed effects
4. Run *coach_survival_additional_analysis.py* to create data for Rooney Rule analyses
5. Run *coach_survival_additional_analysis.R* to run the Rooney Rule models
6. Run *coach_init.py* to compute differences in the initial conditions faced by new head coaches
